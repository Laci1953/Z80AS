# Z80AS
Z80 Assembler compatible with HiTech tools

Z80AS is a macro-assembler for Z80 microcomputers, running on the CP/M operating system. 
It runs on Z80-based computers, assembles Z80 source code and is compatible with the HiTech C compiler, ZAS assembler and LINK linker.
It is a major rewrite of the Z80ASM assembler which first appeared on CP/M US User Group, Vol 16. 
The original source was Copyright (C) 1977, Lehman Consulting Services and was put into the public domain. 
It was further modified by Ray Halls in 1982 and Neil Harrison in 1983. 
Last known version was 2.8. It was further modified by Hector Peraza, starting from 2017. 
Z80AS is actually an adaptation of the ZSM4 macro-assembler v4.6 published by Hector Peraza on GitHub ( https://github.com/hperaza/ZSM4 ),  
made by Ladislau Szilagyi in December 2021 â€“ January 2022.
Thank the high quality of the work done by Hector Peraza, the adaptation was easy, actually the most difficult part was writing a new OBJ format object code generator.
